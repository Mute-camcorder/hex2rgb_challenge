# Hex2RGB Challenge

This is a fairly short coding challenge for python developers.

The primary thing that is under test here is how candiates approach the problem, and their workflow when developing a soltuion.


### Rules

* Feel free to look up *any* reference or information you need
* Ask any questions you want
* Please avoid changing the tests
* Have fun!


### Instructions

Please see the comment at the top of `rgb.py`, and implement the function and methods that have been requested.

Checkout test_color_class.py to see what is expected. Tests are run with `pytest`. You can (and should!) run the tests as often as you want.


### Definitions

* Two colours are considered equal when they have the same r, g, and b values
* A colour is considered brighter than another when the average of its r, g, and b values is greater.
