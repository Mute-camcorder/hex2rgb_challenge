# RGB.py
# This file should contain:
#   * a function that converts a hex code into a dictionary of r, g, b integers
#   * a class `Colour` that can be instantiated by hex code or by a dictionary of r, g, b integers
#
# Checkout test_color_class.py to see what is expected. Tests are run with `pytest`
#
# Feel free to look up *any* reference or information you need, ask any questions you want
# and importantly, have fun!
