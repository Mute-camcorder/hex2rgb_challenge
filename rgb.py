# RGB.py
# This file should contain:
#   * a function that converts a hex code into a dictionary of r, g, b integers
#   * a class `Colour` that can be instantiated by hex code or by a dictionary of r, g, b integers;
#     - a method `to_hex_code()` that returns the hex representation
#     - a method `to_rgb_dict()` that returns the r, g, b values as integers in a dictionary
#     - you should be able to compare two Colours using `==`, which is true when both colours have the same r,g, and b values
