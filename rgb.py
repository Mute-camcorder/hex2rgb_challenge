# RGB.py
# This file should contain:
#   * a function that converts a hex code into a dictionary of r, g, b integers
#   * a class `Colour` that can be instantiated by hex code or by a dictionary of r, g, b integers;
#     - a method `to_hex_code()` that returns the hex representation
#     - a method `to_rgb_dict()` that returns the r, g, b values as integers in a dictionary
#
# Checkout test_color_class.py to see what is expected. Tests are run with `pytest`. You can (and should!) run the tests
# as often as you want.
#
# Feel free to look up *any* reference or information you need, ask any questions you want and importantly, have fun!
